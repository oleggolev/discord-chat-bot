### Overview

This bot runs as a service that relies on `ollama serve` running somewhere. If that is not feasible (depending on the deployment environment), it is also possible to simply call the desired model through a CLI and forward the CLI output directly as shown [here](https://medium.com/@verma.chandan/mastering-mixtral-8x7b-your-guide-to-ai-magic-with-flask-2c5da9de5d3f).

### Set-up instructions
1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (if you have a package manager, use that instead to install this)
    - Make sure to install at least v14 of Node.js
2. Install [Ollama](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama) (ditto)
3. Pull (download) a model, e.g `ollama pull orca` or `ollama pull llama2`
4. Start Ollama by running `ollama serve`
5. [Create a Discord bot](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
    - Under Application » Bot
        - Enable Message Content Intent
        - Enable Server Members Intent (for replacing user mentions with the username)
6. Invite the bot to a server
    1. Go to Application » OAuth2 » URL Generator
    2. Enable `bot`
    3. Enable Send Messages, Read Messages/View Channels, and Read Message History
    4. Under Generated URL, click Copy and paste the URL in your browser
7. Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and edit the file
    - You can get the token from Application » Bot » Token, **never share this with anyone**
    - Make sure to change the model if you aren't using `orca`
    - Ollama IP can be kept the same unless you have changed the port
    - Set the channels to the channel ID, comma separated
        1. In Discord, go to User Settings » Advanced, and enable Developer Mode
        2. Right click on a channel you want to use, and click Copy Channel ID
    - You can edit the system message the bot uses, or disable it entirely
8. Start the bot with `npm start`
9. You can interact with the bot by @mentioning it with your message
